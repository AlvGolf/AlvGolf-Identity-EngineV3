## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### DRIVER SLICE - PRIMARY LIMITER
**Current State:** -12.2° LEFT (severe slice)  
**Target:** -0.9° (ideal) to +6° (acceptable)  
**Gap:** 13.1° difference  

**Root Cause:** Out-to-in swing path + open clubface  
**Impact:** Loss of 20-30m per shot, reduced fairway accuracy  

**Priority:** #1 - Must fix within 3-4 weeks  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks with coaching  
**Expected Result:** 50% improvement (-6° to -8°)  

### EQUIPMENT GAP 3W→HYBRID
**Problem:** 46.3m gap (excessive)  
**Current:** 3W (225m) → Hybrid (179m) - no club between  
**Solution:** Add 4W (19°) to close gap  
**Cost:** €200-250

## KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **FIX DRIVER IMMEDIATELY** - Out-to-in swing path creates massive slice. This is fixable in 3-4 weeks with coaching.

2. **ADD 4W CLUB** - Close the 46.3m gap between 3W and Hybrid. Cost €200-250, solves equipment puzzle.

3. **LEVERAGE YOUR IRONS** - Your 5i, 6i, 7i, 8i, 9i are tour-level. These are your scoring weapons.

4. **TRUST YOUR WEDGES** - Short game is solid. Confidence on approach shots.

5. **FOLLOW 28-DAY PLAN** - Structured approach, clear targets, measurable progress every week.

## CONCLUSION

You have the fundamentals of a competitive player. Your scoring clubs (irons and wedges) are tour-caliber. The driver slice is the single biggest opportunity for improvement. With 3-4 weeks of focused coaching and the addition of a 4W club, you'll move from 8.2 to 8.3+ and have a clear pathway to 9.2/10 (competitive ready) in 6 months.

The data shows you have the talent. Now execute the plan.
